'kandakes', which is developed with Python, BeautifulSoup4, requests, socket, and other modules. The tool is designed to scan for subdomains, extract internal links while preventing duplication, and scan for XSS vulnerabilities. The GUI for the tool has been completed but not yet integrated.

Kandakes is a powerful tool that helps identify potential security vulnerabilities in web applications. The tool starts by discovering subdomains of a target website, which can help identify potential attack surfaces. Once subdomains have been discovered, the tool proceeds to extract internal links from the target website and its subdomains. This process involves sending HTTP requests to each discovered link and parsing the HTML responses using BeautifulSoup4. The tool is designed to prevent duplication of links, ensuring that each link is only scanned once.

After extracting internal links, Kandakes moves on to the XSS scanning phase. Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a common web application security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Kandakes is designed to identify potential XSS vulnerabilities by sending specially crafted requests to each extracted link. The requests contain potential XSS payloads that, if reflected back to the user, could indicate a vulnerability.

Kandakes is developed using Python, a popular programming language known for its simplicity and versatility. The tool leverages the power of the requests library to send HTTP requests and the BeautifulSoup4 library to parse HTML responses. Additionally, Kandakes uses socket programming to implement low-level network communication, providing greater flexibility and control.

The tool's GUI has been completed but not yet integrated. Once integrated, the GUI will provide a user-friendly interface for configuring scanning options and viewing scan results. The GUI will also provide real-time feedback during scans, allowing users to monitor the progress of the scan and identify any potential issues.

In conclusion, Kandakes is a powerful and versatile XSS scanning tool that can help identify potential security vulnerabilities in web applications. By discovering subdomains, extracting internal links, and scanning for XSS vulnerabilities, Kandakes provides a comprehensive approach to web application security testing. The tool's use of Python, BeautifulSoup4, requests, and socket programming ensures that it is both powerful and flexible, making it an excellent choice for security professionals and developers alike.
